            <p class="a1"><br><br><br>
            This is one of my favorite places because this place never sleeps. There are people working or playing here continuosly. This place has become the center for majority of meetings.Staying in gymkhana will surely get you to meet new people , interact and have fun. A lot of DJs and various other activities during the fest times are conducted in here. Even for the people into sports such as badminton, squash, weightlifting, table tennis etc come here and practise with full energy.Hence this is my favourite place in IITKGP

                    I being a huge football fan , I find my happiness while plaing football in such a huge well maintained field. There are two football grounds and it also includes a cricket ground too. It is always filled with football and cricket enthusiasts. It is very easy to join a group of people playing the sport here, and a great field for cardio and various exercises.

            <p class="a3"><br><br>
                The Main building is always the first place to be decorated during any special event. It is always filled with people and there is a huge library too inside it. It containes countless auditoriums, where students can organize and conduct meetups. The library contains huge set of books which can be borrowed or studied then and there. The grass infront of the Main building is always well maintained, and I have myself spent so much time sitting on there doing nothing.
